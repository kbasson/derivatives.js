Javascript module that contains a function called get_derivative() which finds the derivative of a valid mathematical function y = f(x) using recursion and returns it. This algorithm finds the derivative of y with respect to x, so the entered equation must be in terms of x only.

In order to take a partial derivative with respect to x, replace y values with constant variable 'f'.
In order to take a partial derivative with respect to y, replace x values with constant variable 'f' and replace y values with 'x'.

Call get_derivative() and pass a mathematical equation to get the derivative!
